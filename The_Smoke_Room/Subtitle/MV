Wind.Rocks.The desert night.The summer Sand.
浩荡的风、嶙峋的岩、灼目的沙、寂静的夜。

Natural things,naturally,are what frontiersman should understand.
自然之物，自然而然，没有谁比拓荒者更加了解。

And nothing's more natural than knowing how to move.
但这也阻挡不了我们跨过群山，远渡重洋。

Here's a tune about an ache that we can sooth.
就让在下用这首歌，抚平各位的痛伤。

Let's reenact a snappy scene that duds might find mundane.
先来段俗套的的场面，有俩人误了火车的点。

About a pair of partners who had up and missed their train.
看到这对好伙计，哑巴都得哑口无言。

One grabbed the other's wrist and asked"Buy a man some hooch?"
其中一个抓住另一个的手腕，说：“请我几杯酒喝？”

"Course!"the other said real sly."You're another workin'pooch."
“没问题！”对方狡猾地回道：“就当敬咱们去日苦多。”

He toasts and taps a shoulderblade as temperance flies the coop,
他们勾肩搭背，放飞自我。

Then eyes meet eyes as glass meets glass and whiskers start to droop.
喝得眉来眼去，觥筹交错。

Well if you're feeling spry and gay,I think you know what's next.

Lock eye to eye and elbows hooked and keep your partner flexed.

Wet your whistle,quench your thirst,though be it hard to see.

Having vice ain't always nice,but hey!At least you're free!

Now take a dip and hook his hip and remind me of that scece.

Where words passed lips betweenthose sips and some were rather mean.

But hey!They pressed in closer hey!Their courage bloomed and hey!

They're taking wagers boasting over which their manhood loomed.

Thougt thigh to thigh and pockets frisked he grabbed his partner's wrist.

"got a different kind of drink for you,I simply must insist."

Now my mind grows ffoggy as those spirits fade.

Look now our morning light is seizing our charade.

Ruffled slacks,sweaty backs all about the floor.

Revel quietly as others are proud to snore.

Lock gazes and think upon my scene.

You may find the things they hadn't yet and thoughts between.

Lovers light,morning dark and everything you know.

There's as many locks and keys as you'll allow.
